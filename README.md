# Email-SMS-spam-detection
The objective of this project is to develop a robust machine learning model for the detection of spam messages in both email and SMS communication channels. Leveraging various machine learning algorithms and text processing techniques, the project aims to accurately classify incoming messages as either spam or legitimate, thereby enhancing user experience by mitigating the impact of unwanted communication. Through comprehensive data analysis, feature engineering, and model evaluation, the project seeks to achieve high precision, recall, and overall classification accuracy. Additionally, the project aims to explore potential deployment strategies to enable real-time spam detection in practical scenarios, contributing to the improvement of communication security and efficiency.
